Blob Merge is a fast-paced multiplayer game where players control colored balls that bounce within a bounded arena. The goal is to absorb other balls by colliding with them, growing larger and scoring points in the process.

## Game Mechanics

- **Game Canvas**: Large playing area (1600 Ã— 900px)
- **Game Boundary**: 100px inset from the canvas edges
- **Player Control**: Use mouse/trackpad or arrow keys to control ball direction
- **Ball Behavior**:
  - All balls move at 2 pixels per second initially
  - Balls bounce off the boundary walls
  - When balls collide:
    - They merge into one larger ball
    - The player scores 2 points
    - If balls are the same size, one player randomly takes control
    - If balls are different sizes, the larger ball always wins
